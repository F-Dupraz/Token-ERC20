@dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy.

It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the\n initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:\n

@dev Library for reading and writing primitive types to specific storage slots.\n Storage slots are often used to avoid storage conflict when dealing with upgradeable contracts.\n This library helps with reading and writing to such slots without the need for inline assembly.\n The functions in this library return Slot structs that contain a `value` member that can be used to read or write.\n Example usage to set ERC1967 implementation slot:\n ```\n contract ERC1967 {\n     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;\n     function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {\n         return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;\n     }\n     function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {\n         require(Address.isContract(newImplementation), \"ERC1967: new implementation is not a contract\");\n         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;\n     }\n }\n ```\n _Available since v4.1 for `address`, `bool`, `bytes32`, and `uint256`._"},"fullyImplemented":true,"id":1743,"linearizedBaseContracts":[1743],"name":"StorageSlotUpgradeable","nameLocation":"1272:22:10","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"canonicalName":"StorageSlotUpgradeable.AddressSlot","id":1689,"members":[{"constant":false,"id":1688,"mutability":"mutable","name":"value","nameLocation":"1338:5:10","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":1689,"src":"1330:13:10","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":1687,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1330:7:10","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"name":"AddressSlot","nameLocation":"1308:11:10","nodeType":"StructDefinition","scope":1743,"src":"1301:49:10","visibility":"public"},{"canonicalName":"StorageSlotUpgradeable.BooleanSlot","id":1692,"members":[{"constant":false,"id":1691,"mutability":"mutable","name":"value","nameLocation":"1390:5:10","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":1692,"src":"1385:10:10","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bool","typeString":"bool"},"typeName":{"id":1690,"name":"bool","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1385:4:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bool","typeString":"bool"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"name":"BooleanSlot","nameLocation":"1363:11:10","nodeType":"StructDefinition","scope":1743,"src":"1356:46:10","visibility":"public"},{"canonicalName":"StorageSlotUpgradeable.Bytes32Slot","id":1695,"members":[{"constant":false,"id":1694,"mutability":"mutable","name":"value","nameLocation":"1445:5:10","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":1695,"src":"1437:13:10","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":1693,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1437:7:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"name":"Bytes32Slot","nameLocation":"1415:11:10","nodeType":"StructDefinition","scope":1743,"src":"1408:49:10","visibility":"public"},{"canonicalName":"StorageSlotUpgradeable.Uint256Slot","id":1698,"members":[{"constant":false,"id":1697,"mutability":"mutable","name":"value","nameLocation":"1500:5:10","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":1698,"src":"1492:13:10","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"},"typeName":{"id":1696,"name":"uint256","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1492:7:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"name":"Uint256Slot","nameLocation":"1470:11:10","nodeType":"StructDefinition","scope":1743,"src":"1463:49:10","visibility":"public"},{"body":{"id":1708,"nodeType":"Block","src":"1694:63:10","statements":[{"AST":{"nodeType":"YulBlock","src":"1713:38:10","statements":[{"nodeType":"YulAssignment","src":"1727:14:10","value":{"name":"slot","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1737:4:10"},"variableNames":[{"name":"r.slot","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1727:6:10"}]}]},"evmVersion":"london","externalReferences":[{"declaration":1705,"isOffset":false,"isSlot":true,"src":"1727:6:10","suffix":"slot","valueSize":1},{"declaration":1701,"isOffset":false,"isSlot":false,"src":"1737:4:10","valueSize":1}],"id":1707,"nodeType":"InlineAssembly","src":"1704:47:10"}]},"documentation":{"id":1699,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"1518:87:10","text":"

It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy.

We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in their contracts using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`. This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA ({_hashTypedDataV4}). The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.
